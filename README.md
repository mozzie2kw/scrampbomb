welp, here is a funny project, that when executed, it silently scrambles the computer's keyboard. so-

 you (funi prankster) have an pendrive with *the code*,
 run the file on the computer,
 unplug the pendrive, if it doesn't work - use the file "discord.vbs"
                                                 > copy the "discord.vbs" to the computer,
                                                        > when somebody opens "discord", nothing visible happens (for them),
 now the code inputs "random" sentences on the pc,
 for example: the word file you have opened has 5 columns of random text writing so fast, that you cant delete it,
 it's impossible to turn it off (restart pc needed),
 done :3

Of course, i dont take any consent and responibility of the possible harm that this code could generate etc.
